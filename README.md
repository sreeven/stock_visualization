# UCI Project 2 Proposal:
Our team will be working with a python module to get stock market data from Yahoo Finance. Our goal is to build a web application that provides the user with information about the ticker of their choice (using a textbox to build user interface). We will accomplish this by creating candlestick graphs that visualizes the companyâ€™s opening/closing prices, a graph comparing the company to the S&P 500 index, and a table that lists summary statistics.
